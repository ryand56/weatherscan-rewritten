# weatherscan-rewritten
Rewritten version of the original [Weatherscan Emulator](https://github.com/buffbears/Weatherscan) in NextJs. (Basically an organized, readable version) Original credits go to [buffbears](https://github.com/buffbears).

<!-- PURPOSE -->
## Why?
I made this out of curiousity and it was very interesting to me. (Plus that music as well) I managed to find source code but I could barely read it. I ended up making this project in a more modern sense and deployed it as such.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

Make a new directory, download the ``.env.sample`` file to your directory, rename it to ``.env.local``, and fill in your keys.

### Docker
Download the latest Docker Compose configuration file. Modify it if needed.

The image can then be deployed by running:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [x] Support for celsius units (Implemented in sidebar)
- [x] Music player controls? (Sort of)
- [ ] Fully working and operational
